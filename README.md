## HTML and CSS Refactoring

# Description
The goal for this repository was to clean up and change the old code into a more concise version. I also added on to the HTML file to include semantic elements and altered the CSS file to a condensed version while not changing how the webpage looks. 

The first screenshot shows how I added semantic elements to the index.html file. 

The following screenshot shows an example of how I condensed the code in CSS.
